    <p>I'm currently in college getting a bachelors of science in computer science (a BS in CS lol). I don't really care about pronouns so feel free to use whatever but she/they is safe if you feel uncomfortable with absolute freedom of choice. I am currently learning(re-learning?) html, and have been interested in programming since 4th/5th grade, but before that I still wanted to create videogames I just didn't understand that programming was a thing that existed until I was like 10. This website is sort of a life archive or a home base for information about me and the things that I do/make as not everything fits on github or on a social media site.</p>
    
    <br><br>
    
    <p>I became interested in videogames the day I was born, or whatever day my parents after having me decided to play a video game where I could see the screen, but I became interested in making games after I played a few Harvest Moon games, and I found out how games were made(programming) once I discovered self-made/self-published games on the internet. There is one self-published game that I will not speak the name of to anyone that I do not compleatly trust with that information(the creator of the game and my best friend) as I have not consumed the source material for what the game is based off of, however I played the game far too many times for what it was. Another self-published game it's called"Summoners Saga' I recently re-found the game, and if you saw my website when I was still looking for it, wow. It's actually a series and it's about this girl named Misa, shes half-angel half-demon and she's looking for her parents, Kai, the orange(red?) hair guy is her owner. I've left my searching for the game from memory fanart, but I've also added the offical starting image of the game.</p>
